  <h1>Our Story

<p>We're really excited to share our story with you all as we embark on our journey as life partners.</p>

<h2>How We Met</h2>

    Rob and Annie met at Lucky 13, where she’s been a bartender for 10 years. In 2012, Rob and the members of We Are Fauna would have Sunday night practice, and then come to Lucky 13 to hang out afterwards. It was a weekly tradition. Soon, the band became Annie’s favorite regulars. After a while, Rob started staying at Lucky 13, even after the rest of the band members would leave. Soon Rob became Annie’s favorite regular. Then they became good buddies outside of Lucky 13! Until one day—oh snap!—they were in love.

<h2>Double Engagement!</h2>

<p>
    We knew we wanted to propose to each other in a double engagement, but we weren’t sure how. We decided to take the opportunity of visiting the inimitable Ilse Zoerb in Vietnam to propose. We knew we would each propose, but neither of us knew when.

    We were in Cambodia, a mere two weeks after the Eagles had won the first Superbowl in their history. Up until that day, Rob had been sporting Eagles hats, shirts, everything. But one day, he didn’t adorn himself with one Eagles-related piece of clothing. How suspicious. That day we took a 2-hour tuk tuk ride, and 45-minute hike to Kbal Spean, where a river flows over 1000 Lingas before heading into the ancient town of Angkor. When we arrived, we walked around, finding a good spot. Annie could tell something was afoot. As we descended a long flight of stairs, all the tourists disappeared. We came upon a waterfall, surrounded by yellow butterflies. Ilse busted out her camera. Rob began to dance with Annie. Then he sang an original proposal song before getting down on one knee and presenting the ring. Once it was on Annie’s hand, we ran the ring and our hands under the waterfall, promising that our love was a foundational element of our lives from here on out.

    Three days later we were back in Ho Chi Minh city. Annie told Rob she needed to get some computer work done…. And also that she forgot all the research she did for fun things to do in HCMC. Rob begrudgingly agreed to go to a coffeeshop that Ilse (who had been helping Annie orchestrate her entire proposal) recommended. We arrived and brought two café sua da upstairs to a greenhouse, with glass walls and plants everywhere. Occasionally a train would lazily roll by right outside. Annie put on a playlist of all of “their” songs on the café speakers. She began to lead Rob through a retrospective of their relationship, all the way back to the beginning, before she got down on both knees and presented Rob with a necklace. Then, surprise! She actually had a whole evening planned. We ran through the streets of Saigon to get to our snooker table reservations, where we played the longest, most painful game of snooker known to humankind. Afterwards, Ilse recommended we go right to our fancy hotel, where she had gotten coupons for 40% off their new restaurant that had just opened in their lobby because she is actually magical. They went to the restaurant, which they had entirely to themselves, including a grand piano that Rob re-sang his proposal song at.

</p>
<p>

    We’ll be honest, it was very magical. And we owe a lot to Ilse, who did a lot to document and help organize the whole thing.
